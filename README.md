# Linked List

Having first written a linked list in C++, I wanted to see if I could also implement a linked list in Python as I learn 
more and more about OOP in Python.


### Linked List Class
By the storing the head node, this class has access to all the nodes in the list. Implement methods such `push_back`, `reverse_list_iterative` and `print_list`. 

### Node Class
Stores the data for a node and a pointer to the next node in the list.

### Driver for testing (main.py)
