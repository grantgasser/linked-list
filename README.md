# Summary

This started as a practice project to implement a linked list in Python. Having learned data structures in C++, I wanted to see how to implement them in Python as I learn more about OOP in Python. 

This project is also an exercise in seeing how interrelated common data structures are. For example, a linked list can be implemented as a stack. Also, a binary search tree can be built using the core functionality (nodes and pointers) of a linked list. Additionally, a tree can also be thought of as a graph where the nodes and pointers are vertices and edges. 

The project will probably be renamed, since linked-list will no longer be very descriptive. This is an experimental project.


## Linked List (base of the project)
Using the Node class, the List class just contains a head. It has methods that allow it to retrieve the head, append new data, get data at a certain position, insert, delete, reverse, and more.

## Stack 
Inherits from the Linked List class. 

## Tree Node 
Inherits from Node class used for linked lists. 

## Binary Search Tree
Using the tree node class, creates a binary search tree with given data.
